*Purpose*: Throughout this course, you'll complete a large number of *exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended.

In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring, documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these skills again and again in each challenge.

# Grading Rubric
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on the report and the summary.

## Report
<!-- ------------------------- -->

The report is the knitted version of the **current document** (this Rmd).

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Effort | Some task __q__'s left unattempted | All task __q__'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not supported by analysis, or errors in analysis | All observations clearly and correctly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and the (in)conclusiveness of the Support|
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Summary
<!-- ------------------------- -->

the summary is your survey response: the qualtrics link provided below

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Effort | Survey not completed | Survey completed |
| Context | Did not provide context for the findings | Provided adequate context for the findings |
| Comparison | Did not make any kind of comparison | Drew a clear comparison between two or more cases |
| Conclusion | Did not convey a conclusion, or conclusion unsupported by the context and comparison | Conveyed a conclusion that built upon the context and comparison |

## Due Date
<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due on the day of the class discussion of that exercise. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJTh2DH8nVJd2eyMMoyNGroReo0BKcJrz1eONi3rPSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.

# Data Exploration
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and document your observations.

__q1__ Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Plot `price` vs `carat` below
## Your code here!
```

**Observations**:

- (Write your observations here!)

__q2__ Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

```{r q2-task}
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
## Your code here!
```

**Observations**:

- (Write your observations here!)


# Communication
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data Science Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

__q3__ *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of your document in RStudio.

![Terminal](./images/c00-knit.png)

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

__q4__ *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

![Terminal](./images/c00-unstaged.png)

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files` folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to include all the files under that directory.

__q5__ *Document* your findings in our [Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki). Work with your learning team to come to consensus on your findings.

The [Datasets](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Datasets) page contains lists all the datasets we've analyzed together.

__q6__ *Prepare* to present your team's findings!

__q7__ Add a link to your personal data-science repository on the [Repositories](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Repositories) page. Make sure to file it under your team name!

# Challenge Summary
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

When you have completed this challenge, please write a summary about your findings and [submit it here](https://olin.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6sMhI2DEvNZBgXz). Remember that this summary is one of the graded components of the course!
