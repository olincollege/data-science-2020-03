*Purpose*: In this class we'll make heavy use of GitHub. I already created a repository for you to submit your assignments. In this exercise you'll learn how to create your own repository. You're free to use this to share work with your teammates, and you'll use it again in `rep05-collab` to practice collaborating with others on GitHub.

*Reading*: Follow all the steps in [Creating a Repository](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/03-create/index.html). *Hint*: You can `Ctrl + Click` (`CMD + Click`) to follow links in RStudio.

*Note*: For the steps in the reading, I recommend using the Terminal in RStudio. This should help ensure you have access to Git.

*Topics*: Creating a GitHub repository

# Set Up Your Repository
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

- Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/) and click the "New" button to start creating a new repository.

- Give your a repository a name (such as `data-science-work`), enable "Initialize this repository with a README", then click "Create repository". This will take you to your new repository.

*Important Note*: Make sure to click "Initialize this repository with a README"! This will help when you go to clone your repository later!

Next, follow the steps in [e-rep01-intro-git](https://github.com/zdelrosario/data-science-curriculum/blob/master/exercises/e-rep01-intro-git.md) to clone your new repository (make sure to target your new repository, though!).

*Finishing*: When you complete this exercise, [fill out this survey](https://forms.gle/Cvr8tUt3hRoLFb4C7) with your new repo url.
